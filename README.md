# Credit Score Modeling
 
Exploratory Data Analysis on some financial data to find out which clients default on their loans. Experiment conducted on the Home Equity Dataset.

The Home Equity dataset (HMEQ) contains baseline and loan performance information for 5,960 recent home equity loans. The target (BAD) is a binary variable indicating whether an applicant eventually defaulted or was seriously delinquent. This adverse outcome occurred in 1,189 cases (20%). For each applicant, 12 input variables were recorded.
